# Train-Predict-Landmarks-by-RCN
this repository is dedicated to train and use the RCN method () for landmark localization/detection.
The source and original repository is https://github.com/SinaHonari/RCN and please consider that first.
The original repository was very dependent to the face datasets and this repository is an example for how to deal with that and use RCN for our dataset. For this reason some of the RCN scripts are modified.
